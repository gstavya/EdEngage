      <h2>About</h2>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>Reflecting on the various online courses I took this summer, I've realized that in an online course, there is a large gap between the teacher and the student. In an in-person class, teachers can see how their students are doing by their body language, the questions they ask, and how often they participate. However, in an online course, a student is often just a set of numbers. Teachers only know how their students are performing, since they can see what their grades are; however, they are unaware of each of their students' approach to the class. One student with a B could be completely disinterested in the class while another who also has a B could be really interested, but to a teacher of an online course, these students are the exact same.</p>

    <h1>How it Works</h1>
    <h3>01 - Download an Online Classroom Discussion Forum</h2>
    <p>This data must have three columns: the name of the student who posted it, the name of the student who they replied to, and the discussion text. </p>
    <h3>02 - Choose the File</h2>
    <p>Select the downloaded file from your computer.</p>
    <h3>03 - Upload it!</h2>
    <p>EdEngage will provide you with a network diagram representing student-to-student interactions and also a leaderboard of which students have the greatest engagement.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif" >EdEngage tracks the motivation of each student and hopes to boost it by providing teachers with this information so that they can specifically target certain students who are not as engaged in the class. Online courses usually have discussion forums in which students communicate with each other, making comments about the course and asking for help. EdEngage scans discussion forums and provides teachers with two things: a network representing student-to-student interactions and a motivation score for each student. This motivation score is based on the sentiment of each student, which is taken from their posts, and how often they post, since it conveys their interest in the class and how engaged they are with the content.
